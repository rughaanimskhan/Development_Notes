TDD (Test Driven Development)
	=> Develpment of individual functions
	=> Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed,
	=> and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.

	process of the business like

DDD (Domain Driven Design)
	=> At its core, DDD is a way of thinking about software architecture that emphasizes the domain or problem space of a project. 
	=> This means that developers focus on the business logic of the software, rather than just the technical implementation.

what is a container?
	=> A way to package an application with all the necessary dependencies and configuration.
	=> It can be easily shared
	=> Makes deployment and development efficient.
