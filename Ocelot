Ocelot

 An API Gateway is a layer used in microservices architectures to provide an abstraction layer between clients and services, 

it is a single entry point for directing traffic to various microservices and a central place where security, orchestration, monitoring,
 protocol transformation, and other non-functional requirements can be implemented. Instead of exposing each service individually through its own IP address and port, 
 a single IP address and port is exposed for the API Gateway, which routes requests to the appropriate services.
 
 
 With Ocelot, we can implement features such as routing, authentication, authorization, throttling, load balancing, caching, response transformation, orchestration, monitoring, and more, simply 
 and efficiently, making which improves the efficiency of the deployment and the scalability of the application.
